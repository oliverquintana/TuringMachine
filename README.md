# TuringMachine
Python simulation for Turing Machine with a simple TKinter interface.

Tapes (rules):
* TM1 - Automaton from regular expression (a + b)b(a + b)*.
* TM2 - Words from language {a^n b^n}.
* TM3 - Palindrome words.
* TM4 - Words from language even-even with alphabet {a, b}.
* TM5 - Words with double 'a' ('aa') somewhere.
* TM6 - Words from language {a^n b^n a^n}.
* TM7 - Insert character to tape.
* TM8 - Delete character from tape.
